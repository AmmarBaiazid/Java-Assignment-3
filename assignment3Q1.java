				"day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\n",
				"making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\n",

				"out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice\n",
				"started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\n",
				"before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take\n",
				"out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after\n",

				"through the little door into that lovely garden.\n"},
				{"After awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\n",
				"into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the\n",
				"door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\n",
				"went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\n",
				"it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her\n",
				"best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery,\n",
				"and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\n",
				"sat down and cried.\n"},
				{"\"Come, there's no use in crying like that!\" said Alice to herself rather\n",
				"sharply. \"I advise you to leave off this minute!\" She generally gave\n",
				"herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and\n",
				"sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her\n",
				"eyes.\n"},
				{"Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\n",
				"she opened it and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \"EAT\n",
				"ME\" were beautifully marked in currants. \"Well, I'll eat it,\" said\n",
				"Alice, \"and if it makes me grow larger, I CAN reach the key; and if it\n",
				"makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either way I'll\n",
				"get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!\"\n"},
				{"She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, \"Which way? Which\n",
				"way?\" holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was\n",
				"growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\n",
				"size. So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake."}

				{"The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\n",

				"standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\n",
				"him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand\n",
				"and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court\n",
				"was a table, with a large DISH of tarts upon it. \"I wish they'd get the\n",
